Plenty of work to be done for Pakistan as even their net run rate takes a big hit, for India a quick turnaround as they will be back at this venue tomorrow afternoon. See you then, for now this is Saurabh Shankar signing off on behalf of Akshay Maanay and Harish..Our #FantasyHandbook experts picked Kuldeep Yadav as the differential player for this clash.

3 - Navjot Singh Sidhu.Virat Kohli | Player of the Match: I was going to ask you to keep the interview short, I'm very tired. I'm always prepared to help the team in different ways. Today, KL got a great start and my job was just to rotate strike. I take a lot of pride on trying to push for easy runs, pushing for a double is as easy as they come. (On the reverse ramp boundary) Because I crossed the 100, there was a bit of respect for that shot. I don't play shots like that and I looked very bad playing it. Me and KL are both conventional cricketers, we don't try fancy stuff but we can get a lot of purchase through good cricket shots. Great partnership and good signs for Indian cricket. Very happy for him to come back to ODI cricket in that manner. (On playing again tomorrow) I was pushing for those runs and happy for it, but I was thinking I need to play at 3 pm tomorrow. Luckily, we are Test players, I've played over a 100 Tests so I know how to come back and play the next day. It was really humid out there, I'm 35 in November so I need to be taking care of that recovery as well (chuckles). A big shout out to the groundsmen from my side, I think they did a fabulous job..Rohit Sharma | India Captain: We just wanted to get out on the park, to get some game time. Lot of guys haven't had that. That could only happen thanks to a great effort from the groundsmen. I know how tough it is to cover and remove covers from the whole ground. On behalf of the entire team, we would like to thank them. (On batting) Fantastic performance, right from yesterday. When we started, we knew the wicket was good and we had to adjust with the rain, the two experienced (Kohli an Rahul) guys we knew they'd take time to get their eye in and then we can get going. (On Bumrah) Looked good, he swung it both ways and he's worked really hard for the last 8-10 months. Bumrah is only 27, for him to miss games isn't ideal but the way he bowled showed what he is all about. Looking at how we batted, there were lots of positives with the openers and then Virat and KL. Virat's innings was brilliantly paced. And then KL, to get back from injury and then to know 5 minutes before the toss he's playing, to play that way shows the mindset of the player..Stats dug up by Shashikant Singh.Biggest victory for India in ODIs (in runs)

4/12 - Anil Kumble, Toronto, 1996.Babar Azam | Pakistan captain: Weather was not in our hands but we tried our best. We were not up to the mark with our batting and bowling. They (Indian openers) had plans for our bowlers and started well and that was followed up by Virat and Rahul. Jasprit and Siraj bowled well in the first 10 overs and swung the ball both ways, but our batting was not up to the mark..Kuldeep Yadav: Very happy at the moment. It is the consistency from the last one and half years, I have got my rhythm back and am enjoying my bowling. It is good to get five wickets, I am just thinking about bowling on a good length. It is amazing to get 5 wickets in ODIs or Tests. I have my plans when playing against the top sides. I have played against them (Pakistan) in 2019 and know their strengths, but I bowled to my strengths. I am focusing on bowling wicket to wicket, good sides try to sweep or slog sweep or sweep and give me a chance to get wickets..Cricbuzz Live Hindi: Pakistan v India, Super Four, Post-match show...22:56 Local Time, 17:26 GMT, 22:56 IST: The perfect game for Team India!! After heartbreak in two 'reserve day' games in the past, they have absolutely pummelled their opponents today. Their openers played aggressively and got fifties, then number 3 and 4 scored emphatic hundreds. The much famed Pakistani pace attack was made to look mediocre, as Rahul returned to ODI cricket with a bang, while Kohli notched up number 47. In the second innings, we saw a surreal display of swing bowling by a returning Bumrah and an ever consistent Siraj. They troubled both edges and produced many jaffas, but the ball of the match came from Hardik Pandya to knock over an in-form Babar. That ball will be replayed and make its way to social media with flashy edits for a long, long time. Then Shardul produced a peach to dismiss Rizwan, and then came the Kuldeep Yadav show. He extracted a lot out of this surface which till then seemed like a pacer's paradise, turning the ball both ways at ease to end with figures of 5/25. For Pakistan, Haris Rauf and Naseem didn't come out to bat, and their potential injuries would be big concerns. Plenty to work on for Babar. For India, this was everything they could dream of with Rohit, Gill, Rahul, Kohli, Bumrah, Shardul, Kuldeep all playing crucial roles, with a supporting performance from Shreyas Iyer's back as well... Over to the presentations now!.Kuldeep Yadav to Faheem Ashraf, out Bowled!! Fifer for Kuldeep!!

Umpire Chris Gaffaney conveys the message to the Indian team, who are almost out on the park, while umpire Ruchira Palliyaguruge walks up to the Pakistan dressing room to relay the message. We are starting at 21:20 local. That is 10 minutes from now. We have not lost any overs. The Indian players are hanging around the rope and some of them are going through the fielding drills..TANISHK: You have to appreciate the quality of umpiring, especially in this match..21:00 Local Time, 15:30 GMT, 21:00 IST: More covers are coming on now. The covers on the square were never removed and the groundstaff are bringing more tarpaulin sheets. We have started losing overs for sure as we already lost 100 minutes at the start of the day. Rohit and Jadeja are out on the ground, Dravid is speaking to umpire Chris Gaffaney and the covers are coming off again.

The umpires are waiting just beyond the boundary rope to conduct their inspection. The whole ground was not covered and the rain was not too heavy, so we might not be too far from resumption.

230 in 24
244 in 26.20:13 Local Time, 14:43 GMT, 20:13 IST: The rain has picked up a bit now. Just a reminder, Pakistan must have batted atleast 20 overs for this game to have a result through DLS. So just in case we can't have anymore cricket, the points will be shared. But we still have almost 3 hours to go before we reach that territory.20:09 Local Time, 14:39 GMT, 20:09 IST: Play stopped due to rain. The showers came out of nowhere and it has suprised everyone. Not too heavy but surely we can't continue playing. Groundsmen are rushing to cover the pitch and outfield. After a riveting spell of pace bowling, the rain plays spoilsport. But it gives us all a breather to sit back and admire the swing bowling we've seen from the Indians.

A length ball that pitched just outside leg and went on through to get Fakhar Zaman on the back pad. The ball deflects towards point and the batters sneak a leg bye.India review for an LBW. This might not be the smartest decision as to the naked eye felt it was sliding down leg. Nothing on Snicko. Pitched outside leg though!!.Siraj to Fakhar Zaman, FOUR, a bit too full on off stump, Fakhar Zaman clears his front leg and hoists his drive to the right and over mid-off.

3 - Navjot Singh Sidhu.Virat Kohli | Player of the Match: I was going to ask you to keep the interview short, I'm very tired. I'm always prepared to help the team in different ways. Today, KL got a great start and my job was just to rotate strike. I take a lot of pride on trying to push for easy runs, pushing for a double is as easy as they come. (On the reverse ramp boundary) Because I crossed the 100, there was a bit of respect for that shot. I don't play shots like that and I looked very bad playing it. Me and KL are both conventional cricketers, we don't try fancy stuff but we can get a lot of purchase through good cricket shots. Great partnership and good signs for Indian cricket. Very happy for him to come back to ODI cricket in that manner. (On playing again tomorrow) I was pushing for those runs and happy for it, but I was thinking I need to play at 3 pm tomorrow. Luckily, we are Test players, I've played over a 100 Tests so I know how to come back and play the next day. It was really humid out there, I'm 35 in November so I need to be taking care of that recovery as well (chuckles). A big shout out to the groundsmen from my side, I think they did a fabulous job..Rohit Sharma | India Captain: We just wanted to get out on the park, to get some game time. Lot of guys haven't had that. That could only happen thanks to a great effort from the groundsmen. I know how tough it is to cover and remove covers from the whole ground. On behalf of the entire team, we would like to thank them. (On batting) Fantastic performance, right from yesterday. When we started, we knew the wicket was good and we had to adjust with the rain, the two experienced (Kohli an Rahul) guys we knew they'd take time to get their eye in and then we can get going. (On Bumrah) Looked good, he swung it both ways and he's worked really hard for the last 8-10 months. Bumrah is only 27, for him to miss games isn't ideal but the way he bowled showed what he is all about. Looking at how we batted, there were lots of positives with the openers and then Virat and KL. Virat's innings was brilliantly paced. And then KL, to get back from injury and then to know 5 minutes before the toss he's playing, to play that way shows the mindset of the player..Stats dug up by Shashikant Singh.Biggest victory for India in ODIs (in runs)

4/12 - Anil Kumble, Toronto, 1996.Babar Azam | Pakistan captain: Weather was not in our hands but we tried our best. We were not up to the mark with our batting and bowling. They (Indian openers) had plans for our bowlers and started well and that was followed up by Virat and Rahul. Jasprit and Siraj bowled well in the first 10 overs and swung the ball both ways, but our batting was not up to the mark..Kuldeep Yadav: Very happy at the moment. It is the consistency from the last one and half years, I have got my rhythm back and am enjoying my bowling. It is good to get five wickets, I am just thinking about bowling on a good length. It is amazing to get 5 wickets in ODIs or Tests. I have my plans when playing against the top sides. I have played against them (Pakistan) in 2019 and know their strengths, but I bowled to my strengths. I am focusing on bowling wicket to wicket, good sides try to sweep or slog sweep or sweep and give me a chance to get wickets..Cricbuzz Live Hindi: Pakistan v India, Super Four, Post-match show...22:56 Local Time, 17:26 GMT, 22:56 IST: The perfect game for Team India!! After heartbreak in two 'reserve day' games in the past, they have absolutely pummelled their opponents today. Their openers played aggressively and got fifties, then number 3 and 4 scored emphatic hundreds. The much famed Pakistani pace attack was made to look mediocre, as Rahul returned to ODI cricket with a bang, while Kohli notched up number 47. In the second innings, we saw a surreal display of swing bowling by a returning Bumrah and an ever consistent Siraj. They troubled both edges and produced many jaffas, but the ball of the match came from Hardik Pandya to knock over an in-form Babar. That ball will be replayed and make its way to social media with flashy edits for a long, long time. Then Shardul produced a peach to dismiss Rizwan, and then came the Kuldeep Yadav show. He extracted a lot out of this surface which till then seemed like a pacer's paradise, turning the ball both ways at ease to end with figures of 5/25. For Pakistan, Haris Rauf and Naseem didn't come out to bat, and their potential injuries would be big concerns. Plenty to work on for Babar. For India, this was everything they could dream of with Rohit, Gill, Rahul, Kohli, Bumrah, Shardul, Kuldeep all playing crucial roles, with a supporting performance from Shreyas Iyer's back as well... Over to the presentations now!.Kuldeep Yadav to Faheem Ashraf, out Bowled!! Fifer for Kuldeep!!

The Indian players are hanging around the rope and some of them are going through the fielding drills..TANISHK: You have to appreciate the quality of umpiring, especially in this match..21:00 Local Time, 15:30 GMT, 21:00 IST: More covers are coming on now. The covers on the square were never removed and the groundstaff are bringing more tarpaulin sheets. We have started losing overs for sure as we already lost 100 minutes at the start of the day.

230 in 24
244 in 26.20:13 Local Time, 14:43 GMT, 20:13 IST: The rain has picked up a bit now. Just a reminder, Pakistan must have batted atleast 20 overs for this game to have a result through DLS. So just in case we can't have anymore cricket, the points will be shared. But we still have almost 3 hours to go before we reach that territory.20:09 Local Time, 14:39 GMT, 20:09 IST: Play stopped due to rain. The showers came out of nowhere and it has suprised everyone. Not too heavy but surely we can't continue playing. Groundsmen are rushing to cover the pitch and outfield. After a riveting spell of pace bowling, the rain plays spoilsport.

Virat Kohli & KL Rahul vs PAK, Colombo (RPS), today*.Shubman Gill: Very special for us. He (Rahul) was playing his first match after coming back from injury and to be able to score a century in these conditions was pretty magnificent. Obviously Virat Bhai also completed his century and got to 13000 runs which shows his great inspiration to all of us. The ball was doing a little bit in the initial period and they also bowled well with the new ball, but it was important for us to take them on and put the bad balls away to put the pressure back on them. I think he (Shaheen) was trying to attack the wickets and I wanted to show intent, worked for me yesterday. There's a bit of seam movement and once the ball gets older we have to mix it up with slower ones, I found it difficult when they were mixing up their length and pace..Pakistan were hamstrung without Haris Rauf today, who didn't take the field due to a side strain. Naseem Shah probably bowled one of the best spells seen that went wicketless, while Shaheen was a bit all over the place for the bulk of the innings. Faheem Ashraf bowled tight lines, but towards the end everyone was disappearing. A tall chase for Babar and Co. let's see how they respond....Cricbuzz Live Hindi: Pakistan v India, Super Four, Mid-inning show...18:41 Local Time, 13:11 GMT, 18:41 IST: What a shellacking this has been!! This was supposed to be the most feared bowling attack of the tournament but the Indians have taken them to the cleaners. It started with the openers Rohit and Shubman Gill coming out with positive intent against the new ball. Rohit was a bit nervy against the pacers, but made up by taking on Shadab Khan for a 19-run over. Both openers got fifties before they were dismissed in successive overs. Then came the rain, a long delay and then a reserve day that Pakistan would be cursing the weather Gods for!! KL Rahul and Kohli were calculated in the beginning, but then attacked the part-timers, taking their chances perfectly. It was an incredible return to ODI cricket for KL, who was back to his classy best with some neat flicks and drives to score another century. Virat Kohli at the other end showed us a masterclass in running between the wickets, kept busy and ended up scoring at a strike rate of nearly 130 despite not having the boundary count of Rahul..Faheem Ashraf to Kohli, SIX, take that still image and put that on a postcard!! With love, from India.... Kohli charges out and takes it as a low full toss. Hoists it over long-on and holds the pose, sails over the boundary ropes.

How big a miss will Rauf be for Pakistan? He still had 5 overs left and that will have to be filled with the part-time bowlers. The players are out in the middle. Shadab to complete his over. Here we go...Morne Morkel | Pakistan Bowling Coach: He (Haris Rauf) started feeling his oblique muscle last night. He had a scan and it revealed some inflammation. With the World Cup round the corner, it is precautionary and we'll have to use the other boys to fill the overs. About yesterday's bowling, I felt that we weren't on the money from the get go, and that's why we were hit for a few runs..The official broadcasters have just put out a Tickr saying Haris Rauf will not be bowling today as a precautionary measure. That could be a big blow for Pakistan. Haris Rauf seems to be carrying what seems like a water bag heater conceled under his shirt close to be abdomen and side. Might be a side strain..16:21 Local Time, 10:51 GMT, 16:21 IST: We have a restart time for 4:40 PM. It will be a full 50 over game, no overs lost. India will continue their innings from 24.1 overs..16:19 Local Time, 10:49 GMT, 16:19 IST: Inspection underway. But the good news is the players are out in the middle. Virat Kohli is having some batting drills by the side. "I think the outfield is fine, and the pitch is a bit damp and being rolled on. The Pakistani bowlers are warming up in the side nets. Looks clear in the distance as well. All good signs, we might not be too far away from a restart," quips Dominic Cork from the centre.16:08 Local Time, 10:38 GMT, 16:08 IST: Next inspection scheduled for 4:20 PM. Hang around.Satyam Parikh: If the game starts today, it would be very crucial to see how K L Rahul plays now onwards. Rest of the Asia Cup tournament is very important for KL and the Indian Team..15:50 Local Time, 10:20 GMT, 15:50 IST: Umpires walking out to the middle for a cursory inspection. Rahul Dravid has hastily made his way out towards the pitch as well, for his personal inspection. We'll keep you updated....How do players prepare themselves in rain-affected games? Dinesh Karthik answers...15:44 Local Time, 10:14 GMT, 15:44 IST: Some of the covers have been cautiosly peeled off. The pitch and the green of the outfield is visible after what feels like ages. Maybe there is some hope after all....15:26 Local Time, 09:56 GMT, 15:26 IST: Nothing much to report. The ground is still covered, the Indian players are hanging around outside the dressing room having a chat amongst themselves. We are still a long way away from play, if at all there will be play....14:57 Local Time, 09:27 GMT, 14:57 IST: The joy was shortlived. The covers are back on. It has been that kind of couple of days. Rauf and Nawaz are counting the number of covers used to cover the entire ground. There are a few people at the venue now and they too are eagerly waiting for some action. We should have resumed play by now but the covers are in place and the wait continues...14:43 Local Time, 09:13 GMT, 14:43 IST: Woohoo! The covers are coming off. And the one covering the pitch is the first to be peeled off. It has gone brighter in the last few minutes and hopefully the rain stays away for a while. Kohli is still looking at the skies and checking if there's anymore rain on the way. Both teams are on the balcony seeing the groundstaff at work. There must not be much water under the covers as they were brought on even before the rain came down. So, hopefully the cleaning process shouldn't take long..Manoj: I think having a reserve day might not necessarily favour India, as the fresh day could potentially benefit the Pakistani fast bowlers as well who will be fresh. Additionally, India will be engaged in back-to-back matches tomorrow and the day after tomorrow., which could be challenging..Praneeth Byna: I gave up my sleep for this match. Hope the rain god can go to sleep for today and make way for another Ind vs Pak thriller..14:10 Local Time, 08:40 GMT, 14:10 IST: It is persistent rain and by the looks of it it has set in. The groundsmen are not even trying to get the water out from the covers, they are sitting in the dugout and Rizwan is giving them company. Cannot spot a single person in the stands as well. So much emphasis has been placed on this fixture, it would be a disappointing end if we don't get a result..Cricbuzz Live Hindi: Pakistan v India, Super Four, Reserve Day...14:00 Local Time, 08:30 GMT, 14:00 IST: Hello and welcome to day 2 of this India-Pakistan encounter. Yesterday we got only 24.1 overs before rain interrupted play, but here we are on the reserve day. First things first, the weather forecast is not great for today as well and right now the covers are on. The entire ground is under the blue covers. The two teams have arrived at the venue but it would be a while till they start practice or get onto the ground. We were supposed to resume the day with India's innings but things are looking bleak for an on time start. Hope it gets better and we have some sort of action. More weather updates to come.. Stay tuned.Cricbuzz Live Hindi: Pakistan v India, Rain Stops Play...20:43 Local Time, 15:13 GMT, 20:43 IST: Play has been called off. But we do have a reserve day. We will be back tomorrow and it will be a full 50-over game with India starting from 24.1 overs. The match will resume at 15:00 local time. The prediction was today to be washed out and hence there was a big call of adding a reserve day, but we did get some action as the Indian openers took on the Pakistan pace trio and set up a good platform before the skies opened. The rain did stop and we were close to resumption but the rain returned and the umpires had to call it off. But the weather tomorrow too does not look promising, hopefully it changes overnight and we manage to complete this encounter. Join us back tomorrow for the conclusion of the game. Goodbye for now...Kathir: BY " full 50-over game tomorrow." does it mean its a complete rematch or starts from where we leave today(assuming it rains now) -- We resume the innings from India batting at 24.1 overs..20:30 Local Time, 15:00 GMT, 20:30 IST: The two umpires are walking out to the middle. The fans are done with their job and it is up to the umpires to decide now. Oh hang on! The covers are being brought on. Has it started to rain again? The umpires are still in the middle and don't have any umbrellas. The Pakistan players are looking up to the skies. They are looking at different directions to see where the rain is going to come from. The Indians too are seen to be doing the same. SKY is pointing towards the direction of the rain to Kohli. Yup, the covers are on with the pitch being wrapped first and then the square. It doesn't seem like it is raining because the groundsmen are taking their time to cover the entire ground. It is pouring down now. Looks like day 1 will be a washout and we will have to come back for day 2..Chris Gaffaney and Ruchira Palliyaguruge: We have got two main issues, near square leg and point, they are quiet wet and soft. The foundation of the ground there is too soft and dangerous for the players. We are trying to dry it with fans and will have a look in another 10-12 minutes. We think we are trying our best as groundstaff, possible looking at 9pm start but we have to see how it goes. Ideally we want to get as many overs as we can for both sides, but we don't know if it is 9pm or quarter to 9pm. Whatever the decision we make, if it is a 34-over game for a 9pm start and it starts to rain after play resumes then we start tomorrow with the same number of overs. But if we don't get any further decision on the number of overs today then we will continue from where we left off today..20:14 Local Time, 14:44 GMT, 20:14 IST: Another inspection set for 8:30 PM. That damp patch is what is making the umpires hesitant to resume play. Hopefully, we get better news 15 minutes from now.20:00 Local Time, 14:30 GMT, 20:00 IST: Umpires walk out for the second inspection. They are testing the sturdiness of those damp pitches, none of them have given way so far, which is good news! The groundstaff have got out makeshift fans to try and dry that damp patch. Plenty of sawdust being applied as well. We saw the hairdryer treatment in a game in India some time back, Sri Lanka have one upped by bringing out this makeshift fan - which is actually a trio of fans attached to what looks like a wheelbarrow..19:50 Local Time, 14:20 GMT, 19:50 IST: A second inspection scheduled for 8:00 PM. The groundstaff continue to work on that damp patch, hopefully we get some positive news soon....19:44 Local Time, 14:14 GMT, 19:44 IST: Umpires had their inspection and now there are in a huddle with Rohit and Rahul Dravid. Now the umpires are heading to talk to Babar. The body language of the cricketers doesn't seem to be very optimistic of a restart, we'll keep you updated... In the meantime, Trent Boult wrecked open the English top-order in Southampton, and there's a game happening in the CPL as well. So switch over to those tabs if you want to catch some live coverage instead of rain updates!.Younus Ahmad Dar: In the first game, Pakistan seemed to have the upper hand, but then the play was called off due to rain. Today, when openers have set the stage for a big score,rain again intervened. Boring day.Gorsi Rizwan: It became apparent that if Shaheen doesn't take wicket in his first spell, the Indian openers give a very good start and later they become a threat for the upcoming bowlers as well..19:03 Local Time, 13:33 GMT, 19:03 IST: There will be a pitch inspection at 7:30 PM. Bear in mind, so close to the World Cup the umpires and the team management wouldn't want to take any undue risks with any of these players. So as eager as we may be to see the boys back of the field, we must hold our horses....18:58 Local Time, 13:28 GMT, 18:58 IST: The umpire just had a chat with Rohit Sharma, and then the Indian skipper gestures towards one part of the ground which relaying the message to the rest of his teammates. That damp patch probably continues to be the problem, we'll have to wait a little longer....Kushal Shah: What is the DLS target in case of a 20 over game? -- "If it is a 20-over game then Pakistan's target would be somewhere around 180.".18:36 Local Time, 13:06 GMT, 18:36 IST: If anyone needs a reminder, the priority will be to finish the game today. We have started losing overs now. The cutoff time for a 20-over game is 10:36 pm, as per the official broadcasters. In that case, India won't bat again and Pakistan will get a revised DLS target which would be something around 180 runs..18:32 Local Time, 13:02 GMT, 18:32 IST: Most of the covers have been moved out now. Still that damp patch near mid-wicket remains the concern. No news yet on a restart.18:13 Local Time, 12:43 GMT, 18:13 IST: The covers have been partially removed, but still the bulk of them are firmly in place. No rain at the moment. We will start losing overs from 6:22 pm, so in all likelihood we will have a shortened game if it were to finish today. The groundstaff are working very hard to dry out a big moist spot close to mid-wicket. We are still a while away from a restart, so hang tight!.17:55 Local Time, 12:25 GMT, 17:55 IST: There is some activity on the ground. The staff are removing the top layer of the cover which means the rain must have reduced or stopped. There's still a lot of cleaning to be done and that would take some time. Many more covers being peeled off which a positive sign..Shiva: Positive intent from the Indian openers after the last game against Pakistan. So this looks as a good sign moving into the mega tourney next month..Parag P: What skills put KL Rahul ahead of Shreyas Iyer? -- "Iyer suffered a back spasm just before the game and hence missed out.".Tribhuwan: The start we got today reminded me of early 2000s when Sehwag and Tendulkar used to belt out opposition bowlers.Ayush Choudhary: The intent shown by Shubman Gill after his previous innings was something extraordinary! The fearless approach and calmness in the young lad defines the heights of Indian Cricket! Kishan in the previous contest and now Shubman, young players are showing their class under huge pressure situations!.17:35 Local Time, 12:05 GMT, 17:35 IST: Nothing much to update. The covers are firmly in place. But there's a reserve day only for this game and the final, so if we are not able to complete the match today then we can carry it forward to tomorrow. Above you can read more about the extra day..Farhaz Shafi: There should be atleast one "roofed" stadium in each country to organize such famed competitions..Younus: really good comeback from Shadab after 2 horrible overs.17:05 Local Time, 11:35 GMT, 17:05 IST: The groundsmen are still trying to cover the entire ground. It has been nearly 15 minutes but with the wind and heavy downpour it has made it difficult for them to get the covers in place. There's already plenty of puddles formed and the covers placed on top of that. So even if the rain stops they will need plenty of time to clear the water under the covers. This will be a long delay and we have Have Your Say to keep us entertained. Write to us about what you think about the approach of the two teams today and the best ones will be up on the page..Virat Kohli one of greatest in ODI cricket, form not a concern: Harsha Bhogle...16:53 Local Time, 11:23 GMT, 16:53 IST: The rain has finally arrived. Seems to have taken the groundsmen by surprise. Sri Lanka's groundsmen are usually aware when the rain is about to come and are ready with the covers, but this time they are not and are running to get the covers on. It had gone cooler in the last few minutes and that was a sign. It is lashing down now and the groundstaff are trying to cover the entire ground. 'Hopefully it is a passing shower,' says Deep Dasgupta, but 'this looks more than a passing shower,' quips Waqar Younis. 'Puddles are starting to form, this is not a passing shower, this is a storm,' adds Dominic Cork..Shadab Khan to Kohli, 1 run, flighted around off, Kohli pushes it to sweeper cover.Haris Rauf to Rahul, no run, in the air and safe. 141ks fullish delivery and seems like Rahul is early into the drive, checks his shot and luckily for him the ball lands well in front of Babar at mid-off.Haris Rauf to Rahul, no run, appeal for LBW.

Just in case you need some last minute tips....Cricbuzz Live Hindi: Pakistan v India, Super Four, Pre-match show...Teams:.India (Playing XI): Rohit Sharma(c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, KL Rahul(w), Ishan Kishan, Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Shardul Thakur, Kuldeep Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj.Pakistan (Playing XI): Fakhar Zaman, Imam-ul-Haq, Babar Azam(c), Mohammad Rizwan(w), Agha Salman, Iftikhar Ahmed, Shadab Khan, Faheem Ashraf, Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah, Haris Rauf.Rohit Sharma: Looking to bat first. There will be a challenge upfront, but the way we guys batted last time around gives us confidence. Every game is important for us, but one thing at a time to focus on. (On rain delays) That's the nature of the sport, it gave us good time to prepare and now we'll look to play well. Two changes - Bumrah is back and one forced change, Shreyas Iyer just got a back spasm so KL Rahul comes in for him..Babar Azam: We will bowl first. I think there is a bit of moisture, we need to use that. Always, India Pakistan is high intensity, but we will take it match to match. As a team, we are playing well, we are focused on this one. No changes.Pakistan have won the toss and have opted to field.Pitch Report | Sanjay Manjrekar & Waqar Younis: The sun is out, and there isn't a grey cloud in the sky. The curators also watered the pitch, so that's a sign that the weather might have changed. We've got a bit of grass covering on this pitch. The pitch might have a bit for the pacers with the new ball, and the spinners will get purchase because of the moisture underneath..We have enabled User Comments for this game, so fire away!! The best ones will get published....For India, KL Rahul is back fit. So the biggest question is whether to stick or twist with Ishan Kishan? The southpaw resurrected the innings after a top-order collapse against Pakistan last time around, but making way for a regular player despite getting a big score wont be a new thing for him. Kohli and Rohit faltered last time around, but they do boast good records against Pakistan. On the bowling front, today is hopefully the first time that we get to see Jasprit Bumrah bowl 10 overs in more than a year, and the whole of India would be praying that his body holds up fine. We arent too far from the toss, so hang around and let the excitement build on..Pitches in Sri Lanka traditionally favor the spinners, but I guess no one has told that to Naseem, Haris and Shaheen. This pace trio have the ability to make even the most placid of surfaces seem like vintage WACA. Add to that, a batting unit that is firing on all cylinders with Babar, Imam, Rizwan and Iftikhar Ahmed all averaging north of 50 in ODIs since 2022. Things are looking good for this Pakistani side, but we all know these contests are not decided on form alone..14:00 Local Time, 08:30 GMT, 14:00 IST: Welcome to Day 1 and hopefully the only day of this India Pakistan clash. The Pakistani cricket team recently tweeted a photo from the stadium, and the skies look as clear as a midsummer afternoons dream, but there is a prediction for rain as the day goes on. Hopefully, the rain Gods give us a bit of wiggle room for this rivalry to be played to a conclusion this time around..Asia Cup 2023: Super 4s, Pakistan v India, Preview...Preview

Very few know the art of survival better than the Asia Cup. It's endured through boycotts by both India and Pakistan, apathy from administrators, fluctuating fandom, seasonal revision of trophies, and even a raging pandemic. Furthermore, it hasn't shied away from switching between formats just so as to stay relevant.

It's no surprise then, that the Asia Cup has restyled itself into an enabler for Indo-Pak cricket in the last few editions. After all, it's the only tournament outside ICC events where the two teams meet and therefore, the organizers have left no stone unturned to ensure that this big match isn't washed out like the last one. In a helter-skelter, unpopular move in view of bad forecast, a reserve day has been brought in place to save the fixture - a luxury extended to no other fixture but the final. Well, you really are one of a kind, Asia Cup.

That said, no one would mind seeing an India vs Pakistan match to completion. And never more than now, when the last one left us wanting for more before a much-anticipated World Cup in "home" conditions, where both teams know that they have a genuine shot at glory. So now's the time for them to suss each other out, gain ascendancy locally and land the first blow.

Pakistan nearly did that in Pallekele, hurting India through Shaheen Shah's left-arm angles with the old ball and new. That sight, it must be said, felt far too familiar for how seldom these two sides play each other, and India's top-order would be desperate to talk back. And there's no better place to do it than in Asia Cup's quiet and quaint setting in Colombo, before the noise in cricket's largest setting in Ahmedabad comes for you.

Of the six teams participating, Pakistan have comfortably looked the best side in the tournament. The batters have done well setting a target as well as chasing it, but they would hope for some runs from Fakhar Zaman who's had a good year but a quiet last month or so. The fast bowlers have made people sit up and watch, so much so that Shoaib Akhtar has been reminded of the "old days".

It makes sense; Naseem Shah's bowling rockets, Shaheen's thinking his "best is yet to come" and Haris Rauf's doing everything right and fairly wanting to be the Player of the Tournament. All that's great but where Pakistan need to step up are their overs with spin. Ishan Kishan and Hardik Pandya cracked open that weak link pretty easily last week, and other good batters, of whom there will be plenty at the World Cup, will do it too. The last thing you want is some late lower-order partnership, about which captains have never been keener, to wipe out the damage inflicted by the faster bowlers.

To talk about India's campaign, it's been far from perfect. If the top-order batting came a cropper against Pakistan, the bowling and fielding against Nepal was "below par" in Rohit Sharma's words. They dropped three catches inside the first five overs and the bowling, barring Ravindra Jadeja, looked rusty. They, though, will be boosted by the return of Jasprit Bumrah, who has re-joined the team, but it would take more than just him to outdo an in-form Pakistan. They are the team to beat in the tournament and luckily, India will have a maximum of two days to try and do that. There might or might not be a result still but we already have a winner: the Asia Cup.

When: Sunday, 10 September 2023 at 3:00 PM local/IST

Where: R Premadasa Stadium, Colombo

What to expect: Long build-ups on telly and ball-by-ball commentaries. Because the forecast is diabolical with thunderstorms forecast right through Sunday. It's very likely that the reserve day is kicked into play but as irony would have it, the forecast for Monday reads even worse at the moment.

The pitch at Colombo is likely to be the slowest and most spin-friendly in the tournament so far, and will definitely have something in it for the bowlers after all the sweating under covers. Run-scoring was difficult in the last ODI played here, with Pakistan's 268 in the first innings proving more than enough; the spinners went on to pick six of the 10 Afghanistan wickets to fall.

Team news:

Pakistan

Naseem Shah hurt his arm while trying to field in the Super Four match against Bangladesh but in some good news, he returned to bowl later in the innings. With three days to recover, Naseem should be fit to go. Mohammad Nawaz might find his way back into the XI after he was left out in favour of Faheem Ashraf on a slightly pace-friendly track in Lahore.

Both Babar Azam and Fakhar Zaman have a negative match-up against Kuldeep Yadav, so watch out for the spinner's early introduction into the attack.

Probable XI: Fakhar Zaman, Imam-ul-Haq, Babar Azam (c), Mohammad Rizwan (w), Agha Salman, Iftikhar Ahmed, Shadab Khan, Mohammad Nawaz, Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah, Haris Rauf

India

Bumrah is back after his personal visit to India and should slot straight back in. KL Rahul, who had been recuperating at NCA Bengaluru, has also linked up with the squad in Colombo but will he get his middle-order spot and the keeping gloves back right away? Ideally, the in-form Ishan Kishan, who is also left-handed and helps break the right-hand monotony in the middle-order, makes for a better pick. India could opt for Axar Patel over Shardul Thakur if the pitch looks dry.

Since 2022, Virat Kohli has made his runs inside the PowerPlay at a strike-rate of 67 and an average of 19. That lack of form upfront is something Pakistan will look to sustain.

Probable XI: Rohit Sharma(c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Ishan Kishan(w), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Shardul Thakur/Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj

What they said:

"Given the continuous cricket we are playing both in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, you can say that we hold an edge (over India). We have been playing here in Sri Lanka for the past two months or so. We have played Tests, we played a series against Afghanistan and then the LPL, so it can be said that we have an advantage" - Babar Azam

"It was my first game playing Pakistan in a senior men's game and there was extra pressure obviously. But the way I look at it is that there'll be pressure in all nine league games at the World Cup. They will all be must-win games and there will be pressure similar to what was felt playing Pakistan the other day, so the experience will help" - Shubman Gill.Squads:.Pakistan Squad: Fakhar Zaman, Imam-ul-Haq, Babar Azam(c), Mohammad Rizwan(w), Agha Salman, Iftikhar Ahmed, Shadab Khan, Faheem Ashraf, Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah, Haris Rauf, Saud Shakeel, Mohammad Nawaz, Usama Mir, Abdullah Shafique, Mohammad Haris, Mohammad Wasim Jr.India Squad: Rohit Sharma(c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Ishan Kishan(w), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Shardul Thakur, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Shami, Mohammed Siraj, Jasprit Bumrah, Axar Patel, KL Rahul, Suryakumar Yadav, Prasidh Krishna, Tilak Varma.
